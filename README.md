🌟 **Personal Portfolio Website**

A modern, responsive portfolio built to showcase my work, skills, and growth as a frontend developer.
This is my first React project, and I built it from scratch to understand how real components and structure come together in an actual application — not just in tutorials.

📖 **About the Project**

I started this project because I wanted a website that genuinely reflects who I am as a developer — not a template, but something I designed and coded myself.

The goal was simple:
Create a clean, focused, modern portfolio with smooth navigation and intentional UI decisions.
No clutter, no distractions — just a professional space to show my progress.

✨ **What’s Inside**

A dark, premium UI with gradient lighting

A simple, clear Hero section with CTAs

Smooth scroll navigation to Skills, Projects, About, and Contact

Components structured in a way that keeps the project clean and easy to expand

Responsive design for different screen sizes

Icons, buttons, micro-interactions, and subtle animations

🧠 **What I Learned (the important part)**

This project taught me way more than just “how to use React”.

✔ How React components actually work

Breaking the UI into small, reusable pieces instead of writing everything in one file.

✔ How to structure a real React project

Setting up folders, managing assets, organizing CSS, and keeping code readable.

✔ Using transitions, effects, and responsive layout

I learned how much a small animation or spacing tweak affects the whole visual experience.

✔ Building without relying on templates

This forced me to learn design choices, spacing, consistency, color theory, and typography instead of copying someone else’s layout.

Overall: This project made React click for me.
